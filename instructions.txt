Instructions:
-Upon launching, you will be prompted on if you would like to enable fairy chess.
-Any response other than “Y” will leave fairy chess disabled.
-You will then be asked whether you would like to play against the engine.
-Any response other than “Y” will leave the game in 2 player mode (No engine).
-If fairy chess is enabled, the program will then prompt you on which pieces* to combine for fairy chess. *You can only tell the program to combine B,N,R,Q,K, any other piece will be treated as not combined. If the piece added does not add new moves (Adding bishop to bishop), it will be treated as not combined.
-If the engine is enabled, the program will ask you whether you would like to play with the Black or White pieces. Any response other than “B” will result in you playing as White.
-Once the game has begun, each time it is a player’s turn to move they will be prompted “Enter move”. This move is to be entered in correct Algebraic notation, though sometimes minor errors will still be accepted
Pieces on the board are represented as follows:
-Uppercase letters are white pieces, lowercase letters are black pieces
-N means knight, K means king, Q means queen, R means rook, B means bishop, P means pawn
-Beside board, if fairy chess is enabled, the program outputs a list of all of the fairy combinations. Combinations that do not add new moves are not output (Ex. Queen + Bishop).
